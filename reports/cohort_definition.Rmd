# Four ways of defining employment end

1. For the manuscript submission
	- Last dateout
	- Folks were considered censored, if indicated as such by YOUT16
		- Unless their last record had datein == dateout _and_ was non-numeric ($n \approx 2200$)
2. Suzanne's employment end
	- Last dateout, but capped at 10 years if the record was longer than 10 years ($n = 3$)
3. Suzanne's employment end updated with what we learned last week
	- Used the last date out, but capped at 10 years if the record was longer than 10 years
